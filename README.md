# Coach’s Clipboard

**A clipboard with a brain.**  
Tablet-first dashboard for trainers inside The Catalyst system.  
Real-time insight, oversight, and course correction.  
Built for coaching. Powered by context.

## What it is

Coach’s Clipboard turns `/admin` into a full-featured control panel for certified trainers. Designed for tablets and built to move at the speed of real life, it’s where coaching meets clarity.

Track client vitals, flag trends, log sessions, adjust programs — all in one place.  
Think: fewer spreadsheets, more signal.
